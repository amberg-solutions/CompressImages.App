For photographs, <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#jpeg' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>JPEG</a> is a common choice because it balances quality and file size. For graphics or icons with transparency, <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#png' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>PNG</a> provides sharp details. The modern <a href='https://developers.google.com/speed/webp' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>WebP</a> format offers superior compression, often reducing file size by more than 25% compared to JPEG and PNG. Google also recommends using next-gen formats like WebP and <a href='https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>AVIF</a> to improve <a href='https://web.dev/uses-responsive-images/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Core Web Vitals</a> and overall performance.",
